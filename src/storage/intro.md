# Storage

Aptos currently uses [Rocks DB](../todo.md) for on-chain storage. The data is stored in mainly addressable storage
on-chain, but the [Digital Assets Standard](../standards/non_fungible_tokens/digital_assets.md) uses off-chain storage
for image and other assets.

## Types of storage

- [On-chain](onchain_storage.md)
- [Off-chain](offchain_storage.md)
