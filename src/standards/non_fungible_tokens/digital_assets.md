# Digital Assets

The digital asset standard is a token standard for both non-fungible and semi-fungible tokens. It's important to note
that combining the fungible asset standard and the digital asset standard create semi-fungible tokens. Note that this is
built upon the [object model](../../data_models/object_model.md).
