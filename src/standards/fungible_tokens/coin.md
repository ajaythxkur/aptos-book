# Coin (Legacy)

Coin is the original standard for fungible tokens on Aptos. It is being replaced with
the [fungible asset standard](fungible_assets.md), which allows for much more flexibility and more fine-grained control
over the fungible tokens. Note that APT is a Coin
being [migrated to the fungible asset](#migrating-coins-to-fungible-asset).
