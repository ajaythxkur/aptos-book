# IO

IO operations are the amount of reads and writes done to existing storage slots (or storage slots after they are
created). This includes things like:

- Writing to existing storage
- Adding values to a vector and saving it in storage
- Deleting values from a vector and saving it in storage
- Reading existing storage slots
