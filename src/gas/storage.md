# Storage Deposit / Refund

Storage deposit (and subsequent refund) are based on the number of storage slots _created_ or _deleted_. Each storage
slot has a cost associated with it, which is deposited to encourage freeing of storage slots later. The storage slots
that are freed will then refund the fee payer of the transaction, possibly even making their transaction be free or even
pay them for the transaction.
