### macOS installation

We suggest installing with Homebrew. If you have it installed, you can simply run on the Terminal:

```shell
brew install aptos
```

Otherwise, you can open a Terminal and run the automatic installation script.

```shell
curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh
```
