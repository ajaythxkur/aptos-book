# Aptos Data Models

Aptos uses 2 major data models to provide flexibility for developers.  They are:

- The [**Account** model](data_models/account_model.md), which will be most familiar to EVM developers.
- The [**Object** model](data_models/object_model.md), which will be most familiar to Solana and Sui developers as PDAs and Objects accordingly.
