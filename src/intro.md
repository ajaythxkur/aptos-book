# Introduction

The Aptos book is an extension to the source documentation in the Move book. The purpose of the Aptos book is to
provide a single resource for design patterns, usage, and other resources for building on Aptos. This should only be
providing context for how to build on Aptos, and anything needed for that. The additional benefit is that it can be run
entirely offline, for other locations.

# Get Started

To use this book, you can skip ahead to different sections for specific topics. However, it is mostly structured so that
the reader first learns about the building blocks of Aptos and then builds up to writing Move contracts on top.

It's suggested to learn in the order of chapters of the book. You can also use the search bar to find specific topics
or keywords.
